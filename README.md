# Supervised Machine Learning Flowchart

A flowchart to guide you through the process of a Supervised Machine Learning problem. The flowchart outlines general processes, provides small explanations next to some of the steps, and shows what specific evaluation metrics to look for depending on whether your problem is Regression or Classification.

**Note:** the flowchart is too large to view on Github directly. Right click the `.JPEG` file and click `Open Link in New Tab` to see the flowchart.

**Not every specific solution is shown in the chart, so some outside knowledege is needed for a more holistic view on the Supervised Learning workflow.**
